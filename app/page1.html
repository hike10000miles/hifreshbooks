		<h3>About me</h3>
		<p>I used to live in Edmonton while working on my bachelor's degree in Sociology. I was one of the two students majored in an arts' program who came from China. While most of my peers were busy with numbers and equations, I was catching up reading on social theory. During the last year of my degree, I took a class on science, technology, and society.  I researched on the history of AI development for my class project; that was when I started to get interested in the fast-growing technology industry.</p>
		<p>After I moved to Toronto, I started to learn how to make websites with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. That first line of "Hello world" wrapped in HTML tags quickly turned into a new passion for me; now I have moved on learning Rails development while taking computer science courses online.</p>
